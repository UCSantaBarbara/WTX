The Web Technology Exchange (WTX) is an informally organized group of web professionals on campus.  Our Mission is to informally communicate and share information about useful web technologies and resources that are used by the group members.  One of our primary topics, Drupal, is reflective of the group's heritage.

Current meeting schedule:  Third Tuesday of the month, at 10:00am in the Ellison 6840 Conference Room.

WTX meeting announcements are distributed here and via the WTX Mail List

Current Co-Chairs:  Aaron Martin & Gary Scott.

WTX Heritage:  The WTX was transformed from the Drupal Users Group (DUG).  That group's expanding focus on technologies not directly related to Drupal, prompted the group to "morph" into it's new incarnation.
