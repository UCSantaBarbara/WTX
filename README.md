# WTX - Web Technology Exchange

## Mission

The Web Technology Exchange (WTX) is an informally organized group of web professionals on campus. Our Mission is to informally communicate and share information about useful web technologies and resources that are used by the group members. One of our primary topics, Drupal, is reflective of the group's heritage.

## Current meeting schedule:

Third Tuesday of the month, at 10:00am in the Ellison 6840 Conference Room.

WTX meeting announcements are distributed here and via the WTX Mail List. The mailing list may be shifted to Google Groups soon.

## Current Co-Chairs:

- Aaron Martin
- Gary Scott

## This repo:

The following is the loose structure of this repo:

- [archive](archive) - content archived from the old it.ucsb.edu site which is being retired and re-incarnated for a different purpose.
- [meetings](meetings) - going forward meeting pages will be kept here.

## History and WTX Heritage:

The WTX was transformed from the Drupal Users Group (DUG). That group's expanding focus on technologies not directly related to Drupal, prompted the group to "morph" into it's new incarnation.
